# Mo Weather
The Mo-Weather app provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts. It offers a clean and intuitive interface to check current conditions, forecasts, and weather-related information. In this version of the app, we introduce the `CircularProgressIndicator` widget to enhance user experience during data loading. We also delve into essential topics such as networking, JSON data handling, and HTTP requests, which are crucial for fetching and displaying weather data from an external API.

## Key Widgets Used

### CircularProgressIndicator
- **Description**: `CircularProgressIndicator` is a widget that displays a circular loading spinner, indicating that a process is ongoing. It provides a visual cue to users that data is being fetched or processed.
- **Use Case in Mo-Weather App**: The `CircularProgressIndicator` is used to show a loading spinner while weather data is being fetched from an external API. It helps improve user experience by providing feedback during network operations, ensuring users know that the app is working to retrieve data.




## Networking, JSON, and HTTP

### Networking
- **Description**: Networking involves making requests to external servers to retrieve or send data. In the context of mobile applications, this typically involves interacting with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to access external data or services.
- **Importance in Mo-Weather App**: The app needs to fetch weather data from a weather API to provide users with current conditions, forecasts, and other meteorological information. Effective networking is essential for retrieving up-to-date and accurate weather information.
- **Implementation**: Use networking libraries such as `http` to make requests to external APIs. Handling responses and managing errors are crucial for a smooth user experience.

### JSON
- **Description**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. It is commonly used to format data exchanged between a client and a server.
- **Importance in Mo-Weather App**: Weather data is often returned in JSON format from weather APIs. Parsing JSON data is necessary to extract and use the information in the app, such as temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts.


### HTTP
- **Description**: The `http` package in Flutter allows you to make HTTP requests to interact with web services. It is used to send and receive data from APIs.
- **Importance in Mo-Weather App**: The `http` package is used to send requests to the weather API to fetch weather data. Handling HTTP responses, including success and error cases, is crucial for retrieving and displaying weather information.
